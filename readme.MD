# Xenosaga Enemy Database
This is a modern, mobile optimized database of all the enemies in the Xenosaga PS2 series. Each game has been split into its own separate table/tab for organization.

The data comes from the following sources, which I extracted using (mostly) regex:

* Episode 1 https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/519264-xenosaga-episode-i-der-wille-zur-macht/faqs/22927
* Episode 2 https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/06/xenosaga-episode-ii-jenseits-von-gut-und-bose-enemy-faq-545281
* Episode 3 https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps2/929933-xenosaga-episode-iii-also-sprach-zarathustra/faqs/45192
